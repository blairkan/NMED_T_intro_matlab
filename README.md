# Examples for working with NMED-T data in Matlab

## Introduction

This repo contains examples on how to load and work with data from the [NMED-T dataset](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/jn859kj8079). The ready-to-use files are those named e.g., "song21_Imputed.mat". Read more about the dataset in the README or in this paper: [Losorelli et al. (2017)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~blairbo/assets/pdf/losorelli2017ISMIR.pdf). 

## How to use

These examples are structured as a set of functions, which each do one thing. Users can call the functions in their own analyses, or pull out the content of a given function into their own function or script. 

It is the responsibility of the user to already have the ready-to-use NMED data files downloaded and [added to their Matlab path](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html). 

## Dependencies

It is recommended to have the following repos in your path to run these examples:
